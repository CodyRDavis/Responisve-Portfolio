        <strong>Born</strong> and raised in Austin Texas, I have always been surrounded by technology. I can't remember a time when my family did not own a computer, my father worked for AMD, and for my second birthday I received a gameboy. In highschool I dipped my toes into programming and started my adventures with Javascript. In college I was introduced to Csharp. It was around that time I sat down with a couple of my friends and tried to create an android app.

        <strong>I</strong> joined the Navy in 2013 where I was educated and trained as a network technician. The military tought me many lessons, the most important being about keeping a cool head. THe stess of the job can be high, and a ship is a small space with lots of different personalities. it became increasingly important to be able to not only cope, but find a way to work with those you don't necessarily like.

      <p><strong>In</strong> fall of 2018 I picked up my adventures in software and attened Coding Bootcamp at the University of Texas. This is where I currently am in my story. please stay tuned to see where I go next.</p>
